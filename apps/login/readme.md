# ZITADEL Login UI

This is going to be our next UI for the hosted login. It's based on Next.js 13 and its introduced `app/` directory.

The Login UI should provide the following functionality:

- **Login API:** Uses the new ZITADEL Login API
- **Server Components:** Making server-first components

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
1. Start the dev server: `yarn dev`
