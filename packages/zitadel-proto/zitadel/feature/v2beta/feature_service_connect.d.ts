/**
 * FeatureService is intended to manage features for ZITADEL.
 *
 * Feature settings that are available on multiple "levels", such as instance and organization.
 * The higher level (instance) acts as a default for the lower level (organization).
 * When a feature is set on multiple levels, the lower level takes precedence.
 *
 * Features can be experimental where ZITADEL will assume a sane default, such as disabled.
 * When over time confidence in such a feature grows, ZITADEL can default to enabling the feature.
 * As a final step we might choose to always enable a feature and remove the setting from this API,
 * reserving the proto field number. Such removal is not considered a breaking change.
 * Setting a removed field will effectively result in a no-op.
